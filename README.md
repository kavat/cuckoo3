# Cuckoo 3
Cuckoo 3 is a Python 3 open source automated malware analysis system.

Starting from [CERT-EE repository](https://github.com/cert-ee/cuckoo3), I have forked it in order to add features needed by me and my activities

For setup instructions, please refer to our [documentation](https://github.com/kavat/cuckoo3/blob/main/docs/src/installation/cuckoo.md).

Ubuntu 22 has been tested as OS and script to install and configure sandbox can be found in the [repo](https://github.com/kavat/cuckoo3/blob/main/experimental_automation_sandbox.sh).
